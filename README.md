# Roche AI PoC: Material Availability – Insights Lab (NLP on Planner Comments)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to **extract actionable insights** for Roche’s planner comments using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The goal is to:
- **Quantify recurring issues** (e.g., "50% of delays for Supplier X are due to capacity issues").
- **Identify patterns** in comments (e.g., "urgent" + "Supplier Y" often leads to Stock Out).
- **Provide filters** in a Streamlit dashboard to analyze comments by **supplier, material, or root cause**.
- **Anticipate impacts**: find the early comments and contexts after which a Production / Market impact comes more often (weak signals).

## 📊 Current Status (29 October 2026)
- **Comments file** (`data/cleaned_comments.csv`, pipeline steps 1-7): the comments of the 174 daily snapshots of `Snapshot_2026`, one row per (material, vendor, comment) with how long it stayed visible (`First_Seen`, `Last_Seen`, `Days_Active`). A comment cell is a **journal**: its dated entries are split, the signatures (staff logins) removed and the entries kept in the cell, separated by ` ¦▸ `. Each step is one function and one notebook cell, so its result can be checked on its own.
- **Abbreviation library** (`lexicon/abbreviations.csv`): German and English abbreviations of the comments, reviewed by Matthieu and Alexis on 28.10; the 114 certain ones are written out (`Comment_Expanded`) before translation; names (suppliers, instruments, SAP codes) and ambiguous ones stay as written.
- **Translation**: German entries translated to English with DeepL (`Comment_EN`), after pseudonymisation; a jargon glossary (`lexicon/glossary_de_en.csv`, e.g. *Vorzug* → pull-in, *Orderbuch* → source list) and a cache (each entry paid for once).
- **Tracking table** (`data/item_tracking.csv`): one row per day and item from **all** snapshot rows (also without comment), for the trends, the impacts and the weak signals.
- **Streamlit dashboard "Insights Lab"** (`scripts/app.py`): one page, a menu over the full width, a password page when shared. Sections: **Overview** (material status tiles, top root causes with stakeholder options), **Filtered Comments** (column picker), **Most Frequent Comments** (similar wordings grouped), **Root Cause Trends** (all snapshots, what changed between two weeks), **Key Statistics**, **Impact by Root Cause**, **Weak Signals** (phrases, context, watch list), **Smart Analysis** (Mistral API, pseudonymised; copy / Word / text export). Sidebar filters (MRP controller, purchasing group, vendor, material, root cause, impact, timeframe) apply everywhere; saved views; PNG export of every chart; explanations and statistics folded for the analysts.
- **Remote access** (`share.sh`): testers open the dashboard in their own browser through an ngrok tunnel, behind a password; the data stays on this Mac.
- **Tests**: 64 pytest tests on synthetic data, no network.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Set up the environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm

   cp .env.example .env    # then fill the keys below
   ```
   | `.env` line | Used for |
   |---|---|
   | `DEEPL_API_KEY` | Translation (step 2: `translation.py`) |
   | `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_MODEL` | Cloud AI summary ([console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai) → API Keys; default model `ministral-14b-latest`) |
   | `LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL`, `LM_STUDIO_MODEL` | Local AI summary (LM Studio server started) |
   | `APP_PASSWORD` | Password page (read again at every login: a change applies without restarting); leave empty for local use |

2. **Build and translate the comments** (after adding new snapshots to `data/Snapshot_2026/`):
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_cleaning.py
   python scripts/tracking.py                # tracking table of all snapshot rows (trends, impacts, weak signals)
   python scripts/abbreviations.py --check --sheet    # validates the library, writes the Excel sheet for the planners (data/interim)
   python scripts/glossary.py --check        # validates the DeepL glossary
   python scripts/translation.py --dry-run   # characters to send to DeepL + cached translations made without the glossary
   # python scripts/translation.py --refresh-glossary   # (optional) also redo those, costs characters
   python scripts/translation.py
   ```
   The same steps can be run and checked one by one in `scripts/data_cleaning.ipynb` and `scripts/translation.ipynb` (see [docs/project_steps.md](docs/project_steps.md)). The rebuild already fills `Comment_EN` from the translation cache; `translation.py` is only needed for new German entries (the rebuild prints their number).

3. **Launch the Streamlit dashboard** (only on this Mac):
   ```bash
   venv/bin/streamlit run scripts/app.py
   ```
   Use the Streamlit of the project environment (`venv/bin/streamlit`, or `streamlit` after `source venv/bin/activate`): another Python (e.g. Anaconda) lacks some packages, such as `streamlit-sortables` for the column order. The dashboard opens at http://localhost:8501. If `APP_PASSWORD` is set in `.env`, the password page also appears locally.

4. **Share the dashboard for a usability test** (testers in their own browser):
   ```bash
   ./share.sh
   ```
   - Copy the `Forwarding https://….ngrok-free.app` line and send this link + the password (`grep APP_PASSWORD .env`) to the tester.
   - The tester clicks **Visit Site** on the ngrok page, then enters the password.
   - Keep the terminal open and the Mac awake and online during the test; **Ctrl+C** stops the sharing.
   - Run it **once** only (free plan: one tunnel at a time); the link changes at each start.
   - A new `APP_PASSWORD` applies at the next login, without restarting.

5. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests
   ```
   64 tests, synthetic data only, no network and no key needed.
