# Project Steps: NLP Analysis of Roche’s Planner Comments

Status on 29 October 2026. Each part names the script that implements it. Part A builds the comments file in seven
numbered steps; the same numbers are used in the code (`data_cleaning.py`, `translation.py`) and in the notebooks.

## 📌 Part A: Building the Comments File (pipeline steps 1 to 7)
- **Objective**: one clean, anonymous, English table of the planner comments, `data/cleaned_comments.csv`, built from the daily snapshots.
- **Principle**: one function per step, which takes a table and returns a table, and one notebook cell per step that shows the rows before and after and a few "before / after" examples. The result of every step can be checked on its own.

| Step | Function | What happens | Result on 29 Oct. |
|------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `merge_snapshots` | Assemble the weekly snapshot CSV files | 25 files read (1 skipped), 174 days, 2,054,131 rows |
| 2 | `keep_commented_rows` | Keep the rows with a comment | 87,177 rows |
| 3 | `split_journal` | Cut each cell into its journal entries, remove login + date + time | 87,132 rows (45 with only a signature or "n/a") |
| 4 | `deduplicate_comments` | One row per (material, vendor, comment) + how long it stayed visible | 2,231 comments |
| 5 | `detect_languages` | Language (DE / EN) of every entry, on the original wording | 1,717 German and 797 English entries |
| 6 | `expand_abbreviations` | Write the certain abbreviations out, in the language of the entry | 1,042 comments changed |
| 7 | `add_translations` | Pseudonymise, translate the German entries with DeepL (glossary, cache) | `Comment_EN`; 971 distinct German entries, all cached |

Steps 1 to 6: `scripts/data_cleaning.py` and `data_cleaning.ipynb`; step 7: `scripts/translation.py` and `translation.ipynb`.

**Save** (`save_cleaned_comments`): the file is written with `Comment_EN` already filled from the translation cache (no DeepL call). A rebuild therefore keeps every translation already paid for, and the file is directly usable by the dashboard; only German entries that are not in the cache yet need step 7 (until then they stay in German in `Comment_EN`, and the save step says how many there are).

### Step 1: Assemble the snapshots
- `glob` + `pandas` read every CSV file of `data/Snapshot_2026` (one file per week, one snapshot per day). `Issue` is renamed `Root_Cause`.
- Week 27 exists twice: `W27_Clean.csv` holds only its first day (29.06), `W27_FullClean.csv` the whole week, with identical rows for that day. A `_Clean` file is skipped when the `_FullClean` of the same week exists, otherwise 11,971 rows were counted twice. Check in the notebook: about 12,000 rows per day (min 10,799, max 12,660).

### Step 2: Keep the commented rows
- A row is kept when its comment is neither empty nor only spaces.
- What is lost: 2,218 of the 48,589 rows with a root cause and 1,889 of the 17,908 rows with an impact have no comment. They are not in `cleaned_comments.csv`; the tracking table (Part G, `scripts/tracking.py`) keeps every snapshot row, commented or not, for the trends, the impacts and the weak signals.

### Step 3: Split the journal and remove the signatures
- A comment cell is a **journal**: several entries, each signed and dated (`login, 2026-06-18: message`), and the tool re-signs an entry every time it is edited (chains such as `a, 2026-07-16: a, 2026-07-13: b, 2026-06-26: message`). Each entry is cut out on its own (`parse_comment`); typos in the signature (`20206-07-23`, `08072026`, missing colon, a signature in the middle of a line) are tolerated; an unsigned line continues the previous entry.
- The whole signature chain (login, date, time) leaves the text. The logins are staff identifiers, i.e. personal data (thesis 3.7): they are not kept; only anonymous metadata remains (`N_Entries`, `N_Authors`, `First_Entry_Date`, `Last_Entry_Date`).
- The entries stay in the same cell, one after the other, separated by the visible marker ` ¦▸ ` (`scripts/entries.py`; the marker appears nowhere in the raw comments), so that their succession remains visible in Excel, in a text editor, in `grep` and in the dashboard.
- An entry that says nothing (`n/a`, `-`) is dropped, and so is a row left without any entry (pandas would otherwise read `n/a` back as an empty value).

### Step 4: One row per (material, vendor, comment)
- A comment stays visible for many days: instead of one row per snapshot, one row per (material, vendor, comment), so that "X% of this vendor's comments" counts every vendor concerned.
- How long the comment stayed in the dashboard: `First_Seen`, `Last_Seen`, `N_Snapshots`, `Days_Active`. The other columns (status, root cause, impact...) take their latest known value; the rows are sorted with a stable sort so that this value does not change from one run to the next.

### Step 5: Language of every entry
- `langdetect`, restricted to English / German, with a small German lexicon as fallback (`translation.detect_language`). Result in `Entry_Languages` (`de|en|de`, one language per entry).
- This step comes **before** the abbreviations, on the original wording, because the same abbreviation can mean something else in English and in German.
- Known limit: short mixed entries (`via SafetyStock gedeckt`) can be labelled English.

### Step 6: Write the abbreviations out
- `scripts/abbreviations.py`, library `lexicon/abbreviations.csv`: `Comment_Expanded` is `Comment` with the certain abbreviations written out, entry by entry and in the language of the entry (`50 Stk.` → `50 Stück`, `KW34` → `Kalenderwoche 34`). `Comment` keeps the original wording.
- **Library**: one row per abbreviation with a proposed meaning (German and English), context (material planning, production planning, quality, logistics...), confidence and an `expand` flag. Only rows with `expand = yes` and confidence high are written out; ambiguous ones (e.g. `LT`: delivery date or lead time), unknown ones and names of companies or products stay untouched until the planners have confirmed them. After validation: set `expand` to `yes` and rebuild.
- **Review of 28.10** (Matthieu: OK / ? per row; Alexis: meaning, English translation and a context for every row, e.g. *SAP / Purchasing*, *Quality Management*, *Supplier / Vendor Name*; raw export kept in `data/interim/abbreviations_review_alexis_2026-10-29.csv`, not pushed). Integrated with one rule: an abbreviation is written out only if it was marked **OK** and has **one meaning** that is **not a name**. Result: 114 abbreviations written out instead of 97, e.g. `LT` → *Liefertermin* in German entries (still left as written in English: lead time or delivery date), `wtl.` → *wöchentlich* / *weekly*, `best.` → *bestellt*, `SL` → *Orderbuch* / *source list*, `QM`, `QC`, `NC`, `GL`, `VT`, `WEP`, `EMPB`; many meanings now also apply to the English entries (`MOQ`, `ASN`, `COO`, `Nr.`...). Names stay as written (suppliers, logistics providers, instruments such as `PX13`, SAP transactions `MD04`, MRP groups `YUP4`); the supplier names are not copied into the public library. Rows with several meanings (`PL`, `CC`, `RüMe`, `Alu`: aluminium or a supplier) or still marked **?** (30, e.g. `DEV`, `ICPO`, `LA`, `TN`) keep the proposed meaning in `comment` (status *to confirm*) and are not written out. The context of Alexis is in the `context` column. `--check` now also reports a meaning that another row would expand again (`QM-Prüflos` → *Qualitätsmanagement-Prüflos*: the German meaning of `QM-Lot` is *Prüflos*). Effect: 1,042 comments changed (832 before); the 248 German entries with a new text were translated again (29.10, pseudonymised, 20,506 characters). DeepL rendered *Orderbuch* as *order book*: forced to *source list* in the glossary.
- **Sheet for the planners** (step 6b): `data/interim/abbreviations_for_review.xlsx` (abbreviation, meaning, language), also `python scripts/abbreviations.py --sheet`. `--report` writes, on demand only, a detailed CSV with frequencies, examples and the evidence of each proposed meaning (confidential); `--discover` lists abbreviation-like words not yet in the library.

### Step 7: Translate (`scripts/translation.py`)
- **Objective**: analyse all comments in English (about two thirds contain German).
- Entry by entry, on `Comment_Expanded`, with the languages of step 5: each German entry is **pseudonymised** (Part C), translated with DeepL, and the original values are restored locally; the entries are put back separated by ` ¦▸ ` → `Comment_EN`, plus `comment_language`.
- **Cache**: every translation is stored in `data/interim/translation_cache.csv`; an entry is paid for once, even after a rebuild. `--dry-run` only counts the characters to send.
- **DeepL glossary** (`lexicon/glossary_de_en.csv`, `scripts/glossary.py`): fixes jargon that DeepL translates inconsistently (in the first 1,011 translations `Vorzug` came out as priority, preference or expediting, `Abriss` once as demolition, `Rückbuchung` as refund). Only rows with `use = yes` and `confidence = high` are uploaded; inflected forms are listed separately because DeepL matches the written form, case-sensitively. The glossary is created once on DeepL and reused (id and content hash in `data/interim/deepl_glossary.json`; replaced when the CSV changes). The cache records the glossary version of every translation: `--dry-run` shows how many earlier translations contain a term but were made without it, and `--refresh-glossary` redoes them (extra DeepL characters). Limit: a glossary imposes one translation per term, so ambiguous words (`Freigabe`, `Rückstand`) stay out until the planners decide.
- **Forced terms** (`use = force` in the glossary): DeepL does not always follow its glossary. On 26.10, 16 of the 140 distinct entries with *Vorzug* were still translated as *priority*, *preference*, *benefits* or *pre-registration* (`Vorzug in Planung` → *Priority in Planning*). In this jargon *Vorzug* comes from *vorziehen* (bring a delivery forward), confirmed by Johannes Höttler (23.10: *request for pull-in*). A forced term is written in English inside a `<keep>` tag before sending, like the pseudonymised names, so DeepL copies it unchanged; it gets a capital letter at the start of a sentence. Forced: `Vorzug` → pull-in, `Vorzüge` → pull-ins, `Vorzugsanfrage` → pull-in request. The 16 entries were retranslated (1,257 characters): 140 of 140 now say *pull-in*. The old `Comment_EN` file is no longer read as a cache source (all its 960 translations are in the cache), otherwise a removed translation would come back.
- **Tools**: `pandas`, `glob`, `re`, `langdetect`, `deepl`, `openpyxl` (Excel sheet).
- **Output**: `data/cleaned_comments.csv`: the useful snapshot columns, `Comment`, `Comment_Expanded`, `Comment_EN`, `comment_language`, `Entry_Languages`, the entry metadata and the persistence columns.

## 📌 Part B: Streamlit Dashboard ("Insights Lab")
- **Objective**: an interactive dashboard that shows at a glance where the issues are, for any selection (vendor, MRP controller, material...), and what may come next.
- **One page** (`scripts/app.py`, layout and components in `scripts/ui.py`): a blue top bar (*Material Availability · Insights Lab*; a click on it brings back to the Overview) and a menu over the full width; a menu entry brings the blue title of its section just under the menu. Sections, in this order:
  1. **Overview**: headline of the selection, ION material status tiles, **Top Root Causes** (bars + pie; Options: Top 5 / 10 / 20, root causes as entered, stakeholders merged, or one stakeholder; comparison with all comments coloured).
  2. **Filtered Comments**: the comments of the selection, with the **▥ Columns** panel (show / hide, drag and drop order).
  3. **Most Frequent Comments**, 4. **Root Cause Trends**: Part G.
  5. **Key Statistics**: headline figures, top 5 root causes with *% of selection* coloured against *% of all comments* (green = less frequent, none = about the same, yellow = a bit more, red = much more), top vendors / purchasing groups / MRP controllers, rising and falling root causes and impact levels on one line each.
  6. **Impact by Root Cause**, 7. **Weak Signals**: Part G.
  8. **Smart Analysis** (Part D), always last; space under it so that its title also reaches the top.
- **Sidebar**: filters **MRP controller, purchasing group, vendor, material, root cause, impact** (multiselect, empty = All, cascading) and the **timeframe**; they apply to every section. **Saved views**: filters, timeframe and table columns under a name (`data/interim/saved_views.json`, local). The chosen values stay on one line and end with "…" when the sidebar is narrow.
- **Reading aids**: a small **Options** button on the right of a section title (settings + *Show explanations*, off by default); findings in plain words in green boxes; statistics and mechanics in folded panels marked *for analysts*; a **?** tooltip on every indicator; a **⬇ PNG** link under every chart.
- **Speed**: the files are read once (`st.cache_data`, `st.cache_resource` for the shared tracking table); a chart is drawn once for the same data (its picture is kept); the switches between sub-sections, the explanations and the PNG export work in the browser, without rerunning the page. A rerun after an option takes about 0.6 s (4 s before 28.10).
- **Password page** when `APP_PASSWORD` is set (Part E).
- **Tools**: `streamlit`, `streamlit-sortables`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, a little HTML / CSS / JavaScript in `ui.py` (menu, switches, copy and download in the browser).

## 📌 Part C: Pseudonymisation (data governance)
- **Objective**: Reduce what leaves the machine whenever text is sent to a cloud service.
- **Classification of the data** (Marco, project sponsor, call of 26.10): **prices and quantities are sensitive**; the rest of the data (comments, root causes, impacts, vendors, materials, statuses) is **not confidential**. The pseudonymisation is therefore an additional safeguard rather than a requirement, which keeps the use of cloud services (DeepL, Mistral) clearly compliant.
- **Prices and quantities are masked** in the comment text before any cloud call (since 26.10): the number before a unit (`50 Stk.`, `10,317 pcs`, `10 + 80 Stück`) or after `Qty:` / `Menge` becomes `QTY_n`, an amount with a currency becomes `PRICE_n`; the unit stays, so DeepL still translates it (`QTY_1 Stück` → `QTY_1 units`), and the numbers are put back locally. 213 of the 971 German entries contain a quantity; no amount of money was found (the 78 mentions of *Preis* are about price deviations or approvals).
- **Actions** (`scripts/pseudonymise.py`, tests in `tests/`):
  - **DeepL**: comments only; e-mails, @-mentions, names of the sourcing managers, supplier names, material numbers, long numbers, the company name, **quantities and prices** are replaced by placeholders (`<keep>` tags) and restored after translation.
  - **Mistral API**: the prompt of the Smart Analysis is pseudonymised by `PromptPseudonymiser` (`VENDOR_n`, `MRP_n`, `PGROUP_n`, `MATERIAL_n`, plus the elements above in the comments). The alias → name table stays in memory; aliases in the answer are replaced by the real names before display.
  - Prices and volumes are never part of the prompt as figures (only shares, counts, trends and a few comments, whose quantities are masked as `QTY_n`).
- **Limits** (thesis 3.8): abbreviated or misspelled supplier names and person names without "@" are not detected; MRP controllers and purchasing groups are replaced in the statistics, not inside free text. Pseudonymisation reduces the risk; it does not replace Roche's approval.

## 📌 Part D: Smart Analysis (LLM)
- **Filter-aware and fed by the Insights Lab (since 26.10)**: the model is told which filters define the selection and must not "discover" them (a selection on vendor X does not mean that "all issues come from vendor X"); the statistics that only repeat a filter (top vendors when a vendor is filtered...) are left out. It also receives the findings of the Insights Lab for the same selection (`insights_pages.smart_context`), written as plain verified sentences rather than JSON (the model misread ratios in JSON): how the selection differs from all comments, recurring issues (grouped), comments open the longest, root cause → impact (with the ratio to the whole selection written out), weak signals and the watch list with their reasons, the change of Actual Stock Outs last week, the root causes rising over the last 4 weeks. Five sections: Key findings, What drives the issues, Early warnings, Risks to escalate, Recommended actions; the model is asked to reason (connect root cause, impact and what the comments say; separate facts from interpretation) and to quote planners. Tuning of 26.10 (same vendor selection, 3 runs): explicit length budget (2 bullets per heading, at most 35 words each), one bold phrase per bullet with an example of the expected style; the dashboard also keeps only the first bold phrase of each bullet. Result: about 435 words instead of 596, 15 to 21 bold phrases instead of 70 (11 shown), all five headings, 8 s instead of 22 s. A lower word target does not shorten the answer further (the model stays around 450 words). An alias the model invents (e.g. `PGROUP_3`, absent from the request) is shown as a neutral label (*a purchasing group*). Comparison with larger models (mistral-small, mistral-medium, magistral-medium) not possible: all requests refused with HTTP 429 on the free plan (5 attempts per model over about 15 minutes); mistral-large is not listed for the key. Remaining limit: *ministral-14b* still sometimes misattributes a figure or adds an unsupported detail (a date, a review frequency).
- **Objective**: A short written analysis of the current selection, from figures that pandas has already computed.
- **Actions** (`scripts/llm_summary.py`):
  - Compact prompt: key statistics (every key states its unit), the most frequent informative comments of the three main root causes, the findings of the Insights Lab and the filters of the selection.
  - Five fixed sections: Key findings, What drives the issues, Early warnings, Risks to escalate, Recommended actions; 250 to 320 words asked; the answer is streamed (temperature 0.2).
  - Display: one bold phrase per bullet at most, no markdown asterisks left; **Copy** (formatted, for Word or an e-mail), **Download Word** and **Download text** under the analysis (in the browser).
  - **Cloud** (shown in the dashboard): Mistral API, default model `ministral-14b-latest` (`MISTRAL_MODEL` in `.env`), pseudonymised prompt. Chosen on 16 Oct. so that the app can run on any laptop and be deployed, and the Mac no longer heats up.
  - **Local** (backup, `render_ai_summary("local")`): LM Studio with Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 (`LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL`, `LM_STUDIO_MODEL` in `.env`); no data leaves the machine.
  - **Notebook** `llm_summary.ipynb`: statistics, prompt, pseudonymised prompt (checks that no real vendor name is sent), then the cloud or local analysis behind a switch (`RUN_CLOUD`, `RUN_LOCAL`), so that Run All calls no model.
- **Tools**: `openai` client (OpenAI-compatible APIs), Mistral API, LM Studio.
- **Output**: the *Smart Analysis* section of the dashboard.

## 📌 Part E: Remote Access for Usability Tests
- **Objective**: Let planners test the dashboard in their own browser with the real data.
- **Actions**: `./share.sh` starts Streamlit and an ngrok tunnel; the app asks for `APP_PASSWORD` (set in `.env`, read again at every login, so a new password applies without a restart; a password given on the command line, e.g. `APP_PASSWORD=` for a local test, wins). The data stays on this Mac; the dashboard is reachable only while the script runs.
- **Limits**: one shared password, link changes at each start, third party (ngrok) in the path: acceptable for a short test, not for production. Details in `tools_justification.md`, section 12.

## 📌 Part F: Tests
- **Actions**: `venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests` (64 tests), synthetic data only, fake API clients: no network, no key, no Roche data.
  - `test_comment_cleaning.py` (23): journal entries and signatures (chains, typos, `n/a`), snapshot merge (partial week skipped), abbreviations by language and on the real library (e.g. `LT` → *Liefertermin* in German only), a meaning that another row would expand again, entry-by-entry translation, `Comment_EN` from the cache when saving (no DeepL call), no login in the output.
  - `test_glossary.py` (10): validation of the glossary, whole-word matching, creation and reuse on DeepL, fallback without glossary, forced terms, stale translations redone only on request.
  - `test_pseudonymise.py` (7): names, IDs, @-mentions, quantities and prices replaced and restored.
  - `test_cloud_summary.py` (8): no real name in the Mistral request, aliases restored in the streamed answer, filters known and trivial statistics dropped, invented alias neutralised, no asterisk in the rendered analysis.
  - `test_insights.py` (16): grouping rules (opposite meanings kept apart, grouping by meaning), journal entries, tracking table, status change, root cause × impact, stakeholders merged, weak signals (phrases, context, model), Lab filters, embedding cache, a chart drawn once for the same data.

## 📌 Part G: Insights Lab (analysis sections)
- **Objective**: answer the feedback of the tool owner (Johannes Höttler, demo of 23.10: US24 similar comments counted as one issue, US25 problem vs latest entry of a journal, US26 explain weekly changes, root cause × impact) and look for weak signals.
- **History**: the new analyses were first separate pages in a second menu row, the existing page unchanged. **Validated on 27.10**: grouped comments and all-snapshot trends replaced the first versions; *Comments for a Root Cause* was removed (the root cause filter does the same); *Impact by Root Cause* and *Weak Signals* became sections of the same page; *Top Root Causes* moved into the Overview; the dashboard was named **Insights Lab**.
- **Tracking table** (`scripts/tracking.py` → `data/item_tracking.csv`): built from **all** snapshot rows, not only the commented ones. One row per (snapshot day, material, vendor) when the item has a root cause, an impact, a comment or a stock-out status (143,569 item-days, 3,977 items): worst status of its order lines, root cause, most severe impact entered (`None (no impact)` when the planner entered that there is none), cleaned comment (no login). **An empty impact means "not communicated"**: the impact is unknown, which does not mean that there is none; every section and the Smart Analysis say so.
- **Common rules**: all sidebar filters and the timeframe apply to every section (only the weak-signal model is trained on the whole history, because it needs volume). Comparisons name their reference (*the 60% of the selection*, *all items: 10%*, column *× whole selection*) rather than "average". Stakeholder = prefix of the root cause (S = Supplier, PL = Planning, P = Procurement, B = Buying...; legend of Johannes Höttler).
- **Sections** (`scripts/insights_pages.py`, analyses in `scripts/insights.py`):
  - **Most Frequent Comments**: near-identical comments counted as one issue, in explainable rules: same text after normalisation (case, punctuation, *stock-out* / *pull-in* spellings); one wording contained in the other with the same main root cause (`px13` and `px13 - No stockout detected`); similar wording (cosine of character 3-5-grams ≥ 0.55, adjustable) **or similar meaning** (sentence embeddings of a small local language model, *all-MiniLM-L6-v2*, ≥ 0.80) with the same main root cause. **Opposite meanings are never grouped**: a word negated in one wording (*no*, *not*, *non*, *without*...) and affirmed in the other (*stock coverage is critical* / *non-critical*) blocks the merge. A wording joins the most frequent similar one (no chains). 1,504 distinct wordings → 1,057 issues (wording). Groups whose wordings differ only by numbers get a neutral label (`[n] estimated time of arrival [date]`). All journal entries are counted. *Why were these wordings grouped?* (reason of every merge) is a folded panel for analysts.
  - **Root Cause Trends**: items per root cause (or per stakeholder) and week, from the tracking table, only the weeks of the timeframe; *What changed between two weeks?* (blue panel that opens on click): items that entered / left Actual (or Potential) Stock Out between two week-end snapshots, by root cause, with their comments.
  - **Impact by Root Cause**: which root causes lead to which impact and material status, by root cause or stakeholder. One chart at a time, chosen in a two-part switch (in the browser): *Impact communicated* (default; ION impact colours, sorted by share of Production + Market, ★ = unlikely to be chance) with its findings in plain words under it (e.g. *S_Quality Raw Material Issues: 94% of its 16 items, 1.6 times the 60% of the selection*), or *Worst material status* (ION status colours, same order). Thin bars, legend above, at most 16 bars by default (the most and the least often severe), so that title, legend and axis fit on one screen. Statistical details: the table of every root cause, chi-square test of independence (p < 0.001, Cramér's V 0.26: moderate association), lift and Fisher's exact test, each explained in plain words.
  - **Weak Signals**: does the first comment of an item, with its context, announce a Production / Market impact communicated later? 1,221 items, 126 with an impact later, median 20 days of warning. Three sub-sections in a switch (in the browser): **Phrases in the first comment** (2 to 3 words, each with its usual root cause, vendors and an example: *request pull-in*, 33% of 86 items, 3.2 times the rate of all items), **Context of the first comment** (vendor, root cause, material status), **Watch list** (open items ranked by their risk, with the 3 elements that raise it most, as in the word-contribution method of Usuga-Cadavid et al.). Bar colour = times the rate of all items (green less often, yellow up to 1.5×, orange to 2.5×, red above); solid with ★ = unlikely to be chance, light = could be chance. Statistical details: the model (logistic regression on phrases + root cause + vendor + status, 5-fold cross-validation), the elements that weigh most, then *How well can the tool anticipate an impact?*: if a planner checks first the 10% of items the tool ranks highest, 35% of them later had an impact vs 10% of all items (3.4×), and they contain 34% of all impacts (root cause alone: 20%); MCC 0.26, ROC AUC 0.78.
- **Literature**: Usuga-Cadavid et al. (*Using deep learning to value free-form text data for predictive maintenance*): on short, code-like texts classic models are as good as transformers; MCC for imbalanced classes; aggregated word contributions as insights. The same choices are made here, so that every result can be explained.
- **Limits**: neither similarity knows the supply-chain jargon: *expedite* and *pull-in* stay apart (0.20 with the language model). The weak-signal model is trained on few positive items (126): a ranking to look at first, not a forecast. Impacts are mostly entered on Actual Stock Outs (internal rule), so the population is not neutral.

## 🔄 Updating the Data (new snapshots)
Run everything from the project root, with the virtual environment active:
```bash
cd /Users/matthieusanner/Roche_AI_PoC
source venv/bin/activate
```

| Step | Command | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 1. Add the files | copy the new CSV files into `data/Snapshot_2026/` | Same columns as the existing files; the file name does not matter, days already present are not counted twice. |
| 2. Rebuild (steps 1-6) | `python scripts/data_cleaning.py` (or Run All in `data_cleaning.ipynb`) | Re-reads **all** snapshots and rewrites `data/cleaned_comments.csv` (~30 s): new comments added, `Last_Seen` / `Days_Active` updated, latest root cause and impact taken. |
| 2b. Tracking table | `python scripts/tracking.py` | Re-reads all snapshots and rewrites `data/item_tracking.csv` (~20 s), used by the trends, impacts and weak signals sections. |
| 3. Translate (step 7) | only if step 2 reports German entries not translated yet: `python scripts/translation.py --dry-run` then `python scripts/translation.py` (or `translation.ipynb`) | The dry run only counts the characters to send. The real run pseudonymises and translates **only the new** German comments (the others come from the cache) and prints the monthly DeepL usage. If interrupted, just run it again. |
| 4. Reload | `Ctrl + C`, then `venv/bin/streamlit run scripts/app.py` (or Streamlit → menu **⋮** → **Clear cache**, then **Rerun**) | Streamlit keeps the data in memory: "Rerun" alone does not reload the CSV. A restart is also needed after a change of the code. |

- Step 2 already fills `Comment_EN` from the translation cache, so after a rebuild the dashboard works at once. Step 3 is needed only for new German entries (step 2 prints their number); until then they appear in German.
- **GitHub**: a data update needs no push. Snapshots, `cleaned_comments.csv`, the translation cache and the saved views are confidential and excluded by `.gitignore`. Only code changes (`scripts/`) are pushed.
- **Keys**: `DEEPL_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY` and `APP_PASSWORD` go in the `.env` file at the project root; `scripts/config.py` reads it. Never commit it.

- [ ] Check Mistral's data retention and training terms for the plan used, and cite them in the thesis.
- [ ] Revoke the DeepL key that was once pushed to GitHub (it remains in the Git history).
- [ ] Have the DeepL glossary (`lexicon/glossary_de_en.csv`) validated by the planners together with the abbreviations: confirm or correct the English term, set `status`, then `python scripts/translation.py --dry-run` and, if the cost is acceptable, `--refresh-glossary`.
- [x] Abbreviation library reviewed (Matthieu and Alexis, 28.10) and integrated.
- [ ] Confirm with the planners the 30 abbreviations still marked **?** (meaning proposed by Alexis in the `comment` column, status *to confirm*), e.g. `DEV`, `ICPO`, `LA`, `TN`, `Trk`, `PPV`, `RS`, `BSS`.
- [ ] Evaluate the Smart Analysis (are the figures and quotes faithful? compare cloud vs local on the same selections); no formal evaluation exists yet.
- [x] Tracking table for the trends over time (root cause, impact, status per snapshot, also without comment).
- [x] Insights Lab validated (27.10) and integrated into the main page.
- [x] Group paraphrases by meaning (local language model, all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
- [ ] Jargon synonyms (*expedite* / *pull-in*): a small synonym list validated by the planners, if needed.
- [ ] Improve the language detection of short mixed entries (step 5).
- [ ] Deepen NLP analysis (keyword extraction, root cause correlations); add word clouds / heatmaps.
- [ ] If Roche adopts the dashboard: rebuild it on an internal platform (e.g., R Shiny, Posit Connect).
