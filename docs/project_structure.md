## 📁 Project Structure

State on 29 October 2026. Every file listed here is used; files that no longer served (an early spaCy root-cause
matcher in French, its visualisation script, an empty NLP notebook) were removed on 26 October and remain in the
Git history.

### Key Notes
- **Data flow, comments**: `Snapshot_2026/` → `data_cleaning.py` (steps 1-6, with `entries.py`, `abbreviations.py` + `lexicon/abbreviations.csv`) → `cleaned_comments.csv` → `translation.py` (step 7, with `pseudonymise.py`, `glossary.py` + `lexicon/glossary_de_en.csv`, the cache) → `Comment_EN`.
- **Data flow, items**: `Snapshot_2026/` → `tracking.py` → `item_tracking.csv` → `insights.py` → `insights_pages.py`.
- **Dashboard**: `app.py` reads both files, applies the sidebar filters, draws its own sections with `stats_engine.py` and `ui.py`, and the four analysis sections with `insights_pages.py`; the Smart Analysis (`llm_summary.py`) receives the statistics and the findings of these sections (`smart_context`).
- **Sections of the page, in the menu order**: Overview (with Top Root Causes), Filtered Comments, Most Frequent Comments, Root Cause Trends, Key Statistics, Impact by Root Cause, Weak Signals, Smart Analysis (always last).
- **One function per cleaning step**, one notebook cell per step: the result of every step can be checked on its own. The notebooks call the functions of the scripts, they do not duplicate code.
- **`stats_engine.py` and `insights.py` compute every figure**: the dashboard displays them and the LLM only receives them, so the LLM never computes anything.
- **`lexicon/` vs `data/interim/`**: `lexicon/` holds the reference tables, versioned and free of real comments and supplier names (the GitHub repository is public); `data/interim/` holds files generated from the confidential data, never pushed.
- **`scripts/` is flat on purpose**: a modular `src/` package was tried and set aside (history of the repository); a flat folder lets the notebooks import the modules without installation.
- **`data/`, `.env`, `venv/`, `outputs/`**: confidential or machine-specific, excluded by `.gitignore`. Only code and documentation are pushed. Notebooks are pushed **without outputs** (their outputs show real comments).
- **Run with the project environment**: `venv/bin/streamlit run scripts/app.py`; another Python (e.g. Anaconda) lacks some packages.
